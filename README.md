## Why Kivy?
Kivy was chosen for this project because it is a robust framework that allows the creation of cross-platform GUI applications. Here are some of the reasons for its selection:

### Kivy Advantages:

- **Active Community and Documentation:** Rich resources and an active developer community.

### Kivy Disadvantages:
- **Performance:** May be less efficient for highly complex applications compared to native frameworks.
- **Application Size:** The final build size can be larger than applications built with other frameworks.
- **Learning Curve:** Requires familiarity with its structure and widgets, which might take time for beginners.
